Py-BOBYQA: Derivative-Free Optimizer for Bound-Constrained Minimization
=======================================================================

**Release:** |version|

**Date:** |today|

**Author:** `Lindon Roberts <lindon.roberts@maths.ox.ac.uk>`_

Py-BOBYQA is a flexible package for finding local solutions to nonlinear, nonconvex minimization problems (with optional bound constraints), without requiring any derivatives of the objective. Py-BOBYQA is a Python implementation of the `BOBYQA <http://mat.uc.pt/~zhang/software.html#powell_software>`_ solver by Powell (documentation `here <http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/na/NA_papers/NA2009_06.pdf>`_). It is particularly useful when evaluations of the objective function are expensive and/or noisy.

That is, Py-BOBYQA solves

.. math::

   \min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n}  &\quad  f(x)\\
   \text{s.t.} &\quad  a \leq x \leq b

Full details of the Py-BOBYQA algorithm are given in our paper: C. Cartis, J. Fiala, B. Marteau and L. Roberts, Improving the Flexibility and Robustness of Model-Based Derivative-Free Optimization Solvers, technical report, University of Oxford, (2018).

If you are interested in solving least-squares minimization problems, you may wish to try `DFO-LS <https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfols>`_, which has the same features as Py-BOBYQA (plus some more), and exploits the least-squares problem structure, so performs better on such problems.
